A creative professional with a passion to solve problems with tech. With over 10+ years experience, I have dedicated myself to learning and adapting to new technologies and skillsets that have enabled me to maintain roles in design, development & consulting.

In recent years, I have focused my attention within front-end development, pairing that with my life-long appreciation for great design to craft memorable and accessible user experiences.

In my spare time, I enjoy doing photography, creating [voxel art](https://ephtracy.github.io), and learning [Blender 3D](https://www.blender.org).
